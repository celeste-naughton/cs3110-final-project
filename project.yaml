  Our project recreates the functionality and excitment of Monopoly Deal with 
  Ocaml. Players can draw and play various card types, including properties, money, 
  and action cards that enable interactions between players, such as stealing or swapping 
  properties, and collecting or paying debts. We abide by all the rules of the traditional 
  Monopoly Deal game, and allow for support for up to 5 players.
